UML static methods and variables are noted by underlining them.  So, the readConfigFile method in the BrickBreakerIO class should be underlined in the UML class diagram.
The readConfigFile method should return an array of level objects -- not void:   +readConfigFile( String configFilename ) : Level[]
Your assignment does not have point values associated with the completion of each level.
Level 1 - 20%
Level 2 - 45%
Level 3 - 65%
Level 4 - 90%
Level 5 - 100%
